# Binary Search on a rotated array finds a target value in a sorted array 
# that has been rotated (shifted) at some pivot.
# It uses a modified binary search: at each step determine which half is sorted and 
# decide which half can possibly contain the target.

# Explanation

# A rotated sorted array looks like [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] â€” 
# originally sorted but rotated at pivot between 7 and 0. 
# Standard binary search fails because the whole array isn't strictly sorted. 
# The trick: at every step check whether the left or right half is sorted (compare nums[left] and nums[mid]). 
# If the left half is sorted and the target lies inside that sorted range, search left; 
# otherwise search right. Mirror the logic if the right half is sorted. 
# This keeps the search O(log n) for arrays without duplicates.

def search_rotated(nums, target):
    left = 0 
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        else: 
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
